## Introduction
The supply chain industry faces challenges related to transparency, traceability, and accountability. This project addresses these challenges by leveraging blockchain technology to create a decentralized supply chain tracking DApp. The DApp allows various stakeholders to interact with the supply chain process securely and efficiently.

## Project Overview
This project involves the development of a decentralized supply chain tracking DApp that utilizes smart contracts on the Oasis blockchain. The DApp includes the following key components:

1. **Smart Contracts**: Smart contracts are deployed on the Oasis blockchain to store and manage supply chain data, including item details, order status, approvals, and shipments.

2. **User Interface (UI)**: The DApp provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to interact with smart contracts. Users can order items, approve orders, cancel orders, and track item statuses.

3. **Custom Hooks:** Custom React hooks are developed to encapsulate the interaction with smart contracts. These hooks provide easy-to-use functions for various supply chain operations.

4. **Frontend:** The frontend of the DApp is built using React.js, Chakra UI, Rainbowkit, Wagmi, and other libraries. It displays item details, order history, and actions available to users and admins.

## Features
- **Order items:** Users can place orders for new items.
- **Approve orders**: Authorized parties can approve ordered items.
- **Cancel orders**: Users can cancel their orders.
-  **Ship items**: Approved items can be shipped to their destination.
- **Search and track items**: Users can search for items by ID and track their status.

## Getting Started

### Access the Live DApp
You can access the live Decentralized Supply Chain Tracking DApp by visiting the following URL: https://oasis-supplychaintracker.vercel.app/

### Run the DApp Locally
If you prefer to run the DApp on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/oasis-supply-chain-dapp.git`
2. **Install dependencies**: cd `oasis-supply-chain-dapp` && `npm install`
3. Configure contract addresses and ABI in respective files.
4. Run the DApp: `npm run dev`

## How to Use
- **Connect Wallet**: Click the "Connect Wallet" button to connect your wallet.
- **Order Item**: Users can enter the item name and click "`Order`" to place an order.
- **Approve Item**: Only authorized parties can approve ordered items.
- **Cancel Item**: Users can cancel their orders.
- **Ship Item**: Approved items can be shipped only by authorized parties.
- **Search and Track**: Enter an item ID to search and track its details and status.

## Impact and Benefits
The decentralized supply chain tracking DApp offers several benefits:

1. **Transparency**: All stakeholders have real-time access to supply chain data, enhancing transparency and reducing information asymmetry.

2. **Efficiency**: Smart contracts automate processes, reducing paperwork and manual interventions, thereby increasing efficiency.

3. **Traceability**: The DApp enables end-to-end traceability of items, enhancing accountability and reducing the risk of fraud.

4. **Cost Savings**: Automation and transparency lead to cost savings by minimizing errors and inefficiencies.

5. **Trust**: The immutability of blockchain ensures data integrity, building trust among supply chain participants.
